# `Doc2Vec` Training
The `doc2vec_trainer.py` file in this folder will automatically train the Doc2Vec vectors for each documents in the specified folder. The return of this `.py` file will be a `csv` file. Each row would be a file's vector, which is 300 dimensional. The output `csv` file was later used for **GBT/RF Doc2Vec models**.
